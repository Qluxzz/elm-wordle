# Elm Wordle

A clone of the popular word guessing game Wordle.

## How to play:

Wordle is a word game where you have six attempts
to guess the correct five letter word

For each attempt you will get the result of that attempt:

If a letter is in the correct spot it is marked with a green background\
If a letter appears in the word but is in the wrong place, it is marked with an orange background\
If the letter does not appear in the word, it is marked with a gray background
